# Data Analysis Samples
I used a simple dataset from Microsoft's page. The dataset is altered using Power Query to look more appealing and to filter out extra columns. The dataset can be seen in the excel file provided along with some Dynamic Array Functions performed on the data.

# Dashboard
Below is the Power Bi Dashboard I have created using the provided dataset. This dashboard included various Dax Scripts created from the dataset along with many visualizations of the data such as : Total Sales by Year, Sum of all Sales, Average Sales by month, Percentage Sales by Product, Total Sales and YOY Growth Rate.
